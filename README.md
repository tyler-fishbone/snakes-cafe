# Snakes Cafe

**Author**: Tyler Fishbone and Shannon Tully
**Version**: 1.0.1

## Overview
This is an order form interface for a restaurant. Upon start up the user is shown a welcome message, instructions to exit the application, and a menu of items. The user is then prompted to enter in text saying what they would like to order. After each order they get a repsonse saying what they've added to their cart and how many of those they currently have.

This application addresses the need for a simple and easy to understand ordering interface.
